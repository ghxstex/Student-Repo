			<h2>Rise of Nazi Party</h2>
			<p>The Nazi Party was founded in 1919 and led by Adolf Hitler. In 1933, Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany and established a dictatorship. The Nazis used propaganda and violence to suppress opposition and gain support for their policies. They implemented a policy of "Aryanization," which involved the forced removal of Jews and other "non-Aryans" from public life and the economy.</p>

			<h2>Nazi Policies</h2>
			<p>The Nazi regime implemented a number of policies that violated human rights and led to the persecution and murder of millions of people. The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 deprived Jews of their citizenship and prohibited marriage or sexual relations between Jews and non-Jews. The Nazis also implemented a policy of euthanasia for disabled people and established concentration camps to imprison and kill those deemed "enemies of the state."</p>

			<h2>World War II</h2>
			<p>In 1939, Nazi Germany invaded Poland, which led to the outbreak of World War II. The Nazis conquered much of Europe and established a network of concentration camps and death camps where millions of people were murdered, including Jews, Romani people, disabled people, homosexuals, and political dissidents. The war ended in 1945 with the defeat of Germany and the liberation of the concentration camps by Allied forces.</p>

			<h2>End of Nazi Germany</h2>
			<p>After Germany's defeat in World War II, the country was divided into two parts: West Germany and East Germany. The Nuremberg Trials were held to bring Nazi war criminals to justice. Many top Nazis were sentenced to death or imprisonment. The Holocaust and the atrocities committed by the Nazis led to the establishment of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, which declared that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.</p>
